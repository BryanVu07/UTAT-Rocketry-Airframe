## 6.2.1 System Overview

The Airframe subsystem is responsible for the design, manufacturing, and integration of critical structural components for the **Defiance series rocket**. These components are primarily fabricated using composite materials such as carbon fibre (CFPR) and glass fibre (GFPR) to optimize strength while minimizing mass. Specific aluminum parts are also used to provide rigidity and strength in critical load-bearing sections.

### Components Manufactured by Airframe:

1. **Composite Nose Cone**  
   Constructed with **glass fibre** (GFPR) to allow for radio signal transmission and provide lightweight, aerodynamic properties.

2. **Composite Body Tubes**  
   Built using **carbon fibre** (CFPR) for high strength-to-weight ratio, ensuring structural integrity throughout the rocket body.

3. **Composite Fin Can**  
   A critical component in maintaining stability during flight, made from **carbon fibre** for enhanced durability.

4. **Aluminum Bulkheads**  
   Fabricated from **6061-T6 aluminum**, providing strong load-bearing connections between rocket sections.

### Material Choices:

- **Carbon Fibre (CFPR):**  
  Chosen for its excellent strength-to-weight ratio, used in body tubes, recovery bay, fin can, and other load-bearing components.
  
- **Glass Fibre (GFPR):**  
  Used in the nose cone and avionics bay due to its **radio signal transparency**, ensuring proper communication during the flight.

# 6.2.2.3 Machining

## Machining Overview:

All metal components used in the Defiance series rockets are outsourced for machining, especially those requiring tight **geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T)**. High precision is crucial for components to ensure proper fit and function under the stress of flight. The only **in-house machined** component is the **nose cone tip**, which is fabricated in the **MC78 machine shop** at the University of Toronto.

### Key Machined Components:
- **Outsourced Machining:** All metal parts with tight tolerances, ensuring accuracy and precision.
- **In-house Machining:** Nose cone tip, machined at the MC78 machine shop on campus.

## 6.2.3 Equipment 

### Equipment for Composite Manufacturing:

To streamline the manufacturing process for composite components and reduce human error, several pieces of equipment are being developed. These tools are designed to automate and enhance the precision of the composite layup process:

1. **Filament Winder:**
   - Automates the currently labor-intensive composite layup procedure.
   - Especially useful for composite components with complex or odd geometries.

2. **Mandrel Spinner:**
   - Assists in the layup process by preventing **misalignment** of the fibre sheets on the mandrel, ensuring uniformity.

3. **Tube Processor:**
   - Used for refining composite bays by cutting them to precise lengths, drilling clearance holes, and performing surface finishing work.

4. **Curing Oven:**
   - Used in the curing process to improve the overall quality of the composites, ensuring proper hardening and minimizing defects.
